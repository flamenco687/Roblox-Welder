# Welder
  
</div>

Hey! Glad to see you here, this is [Welder](https://www.roblox.com/library/5456753037/Welder), the first plugin I made in Roblox. It was created for personal use as a way for me to replace the old and classic Constraint Editor Plugins with outdated UIs.

After months receiving notifications from this post, I realized that +300 users already saw and got my plugin. Even though 300 is not a big amount of users, it is a big amount of users for me and I thought that re-doing from 0 this plugin to give it a better look would be a nice idea for those +300 developers who use this plugin.

So there it goes; Welder, a simple and lightweight plugin about constraints. Just install Welder, select which Constraint you want to create and create it.

Welder has got a simple and clean modern-looking UI with a bunch of options that are quite handy when creating Welds or Motor6Ds. You can also adjust the size of your menu and the amount of information displayed by the menu.

The plugin interface is pretty self explanatory, but if you don't understand how to use this plugin, try checking the GIF shown at the beginning. And... that's all, you can get Welder for free, enjoy!
